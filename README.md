## Overview
This project integrates **hand tracking**, **controller tracking**, **passthrough mode**, and a **basketball** into a fun VR experience. The goal is to create an immersive environment where users can interact with virtual objects like a basketball while still maintaining awareness of the real world using passthrough.

## Features
- **Hand Tracking**: Allows users to interact with virtual objects using their hands, providing a more natural and intuitive experience.
- **Controller Tracking**: Supports standard controller input for more precise control or mixed usage with hand tracking.
- **Passthrough Mode**: Enables users to see their real environment through the VR headset, enhancing spatial awareness and safety.
- **Basketball**: Includes a fully interactive basketball that can be picked up, thrown, and interacted with using both hand and controller tracking.
